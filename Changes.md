CheckBeat

Changes For CheckBeat Version 3:

    Now uses XAudio2 for sound playback.  Versions before 3 used DirectMusic, which Microsoft no longer supports.
    Interface now has the rounded button styles.
    Added a help button.
    Controls that don't affect the beat while it's playing are grayed out during playback.
    Includes 18 drum samples instead of the basic 4.

Changes For CheckBeat Version 2:

    Now allows the selection of division length (1/4 to 1/32 note).
    Multithreaded to allow interaction with dialog without disrupting currently playing beat.
